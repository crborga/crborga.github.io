      <description>Building websites and working on computers has been a hobby of mine for about 20 years now. My web design skills are limited but as you can see I am able to code them. I would like to attend college and further educate myself in web design and pursue certifications for IT work. In my free time I play computer games and experiment with various Linux distributions.</description>
